Apart from these:
* It might be the best to start from the [Contributing](https://github.com/carefree0910/carefree-drawboard/wiki/Contributing) Wiki page.
* If you are truly an enthusiast, you may check out our [Roadmap](https://github.com/carefree0910/carefree-drawboard/wiki/Roadmap), pick up what you are interested, and create the corresponding PR.
* If you are familiar with `React`, you may check out the [Customizations](https://github.com/carefree0910/carefree-drawboard/wiki/Customizations) documentation and try to customize your own plugins and have fun!

## Style Guide

If you are still interested: `carefree-drawboard` ðŸŽ¨ adopted [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black) and [`mypy`](https://github.com/python/mypy) to stylize its codes, so you may need to check the format, coding style and type hint with them before your codes could actually be merged.
